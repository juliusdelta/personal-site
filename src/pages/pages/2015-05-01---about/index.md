I'm a Ruby developer residing in 'way to hot' Dallas, Tx. I currently work for [Modern Message](https://modernmsg.com) on their Rails app. I program in Rust and Javascript in my spare time. I also contribute to Open Source as much as I can. I've contributed to [Diesel](https://diesel.rs) and [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) as well as a few other random projects.
