I'm going to try and post some playlists I create to listen while working. I listen to all sorts of music and constantly like to make new playlists. This is the first in hopefully a long series of monthly posts.

## Dreamwave

I've been really into Dreamwave music lately. Maybe it's the crazy old Roland Jupiter sounding synths, or the snare that sounds like your hitting a brown paper bag, but I'm really into it right now. So I made Outrun, named after [r/outrun](https://reddit.com/r/outrun) which is a hub for all things Outrun.
